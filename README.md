# Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Bayesian-Techniques
In some situations, we have to estimate the life expectancy by looking at prior data. We can get only an average value by life expectancy. But we have to calculate nearest value for age of a human in different kind of situations. Life depends on various components which are diseases, the things that people use and health of the body. By referring these components and prior data we have to estimate the life expectancy of each person. Here we used Bayesian Multiple Linear Regression to estimate the life expectancy of a human.
